These are my Advent of Code solutions for 2023.

I decided to use Rust in order to learn the language, so solutions may (almost sure) not be optimal.

## Running the code
Replace the ``main.rs`` file with the day you want to run, e.g.:

```rust
mod day_01;

fn main() {
    day_01::part_a();
    day_01::part_b();
}
```

Then ``cargo run`` and the terminal will output the answers.
